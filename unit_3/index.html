	<h1>About JANKYfilms</h1>
		<p>JANKYfilms was started by two friends going to college in upstate New York, each favoring skiing over school. In the years since Janky has grown into a well known video crew that represents a fun, less serious aspect of skiing culture. Its cameras and techniques have improved, friends have come and gone, the locations are always different, but the enthusiasm to remain Janky has never dwindled.</p>
